# qbio_490_final
#forgot to add a read me earlier but will explain the order of the code here:
#QBIO490FinalProject_Mut_RNA.R is for R code, run this first for prereq data fro TCGA
#QBIO490FinalProjectProtein.ipynb is python code for CPTAC data, run this second
#mldf_maker_final.ipynb is python code for machine learing (saving for intermediate dataframes are commented out for convenience during code testing)
#mldf_maker_final(save_enabled).ipynb allows saving intermediate dataframes. I coded it that way for convenience in testing/saving and it needs the intermediate dataframes to run correctly. sorry for the late edit, i forgot to remove the comments from the original one bc we were rushing to turn everything in

#FOR SAVING AND PULLING DATA#
#pls replace directory path, we did all of our code on different computers so you will need to change directory path :(
#sorry about the inconvenience


#sorry i forgot to add the readme when this was turned in
